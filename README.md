# Simulation of the Ridesharing Environment and Implementation of the MDP Order Dispatch Policy

This repository contains the implementation of the paper [Large-Scale Order Dispatch in On-Demand Ride-Hailing Platforms: A Learning and Planning Approach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3219819.3219824) in Python. Specifically, it creates a synthetic environment to simulate the ridesharing marketplace according to Section 6.1 of the paper and applies the MDP order dispatch policy developed in the paper to this example.
